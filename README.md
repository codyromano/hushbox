# HushBox 
A tool for securely sending emails that self-destruct once read

## Background
I created HushBox a long time ago. It functions well, but the user interface and architecture needs a lot of improvement. I recently returned to it in order to make some major overhauls to the front-end and some tweaks to the back-end.

## Contributing
I welcome suggestions and feedback. I only ask that you be patient because I know this needs *a lot* of design work. Again, it's a pretty old project. Thanks!
